much as the love of the giver.  He looketh for the affection more
than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved.
The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every
gift.</li><li>"All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My
saints, less than thou shouldest desire.  That good and sweet
affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of
present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but
hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh.
But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to
us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of
virtue and great merit.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">"Therefore let not strange fancies disturb</li></ol></div> </div>
