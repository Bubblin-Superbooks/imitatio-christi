seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of
men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little
value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for
seasons, for holding his intercourse with God.  The inward man
quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given
up to outward things.  No outward labour and no necessary
occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he
fit himself to them.  He who is rightly disposed and ordered
within careth not for the strange and perverse</li></ol></div> </div>
