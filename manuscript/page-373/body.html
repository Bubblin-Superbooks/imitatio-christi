rather than thine own desire; yea, rather than anything that can
be desired.  I know thy desire, and I have heard thy many
groanings.  Already thou longest to be in the glorious liberty of
the children of God; already the eternal home delighteth thee,
and the heavenly country full of joy; but the hour is not yet
come; there remaineth still another season, even a season of
warfare, a season of labour and probation.  Thou desirest to be
filled with the Chief Good, but thou canst not attain it
immediately.  I AM that Good; wait</li></ol></div> </div>
