<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:4" start="4"><li>But true glory and holy rejoicing lieth in glorying in Thee
and not in self; in rejoicing in Thy Name, not in our own virtue;
in not taking delight in any creature, save only for Thy sake.
Let thy Name, not mine be praised; let Thy work, not mine be
magnified; let Thy holy Name be blessed, but to me let nought be
given of the praises of men.  Thou art my glory, Thou art the joy
of my heart.  In Thee will I make my boast and be glad all the
day long, but for myself let me not glory save only in my
infirmities.(2)</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Let the Jews seek the honour which cometh from one another;
but I will ask for that which cometh from God only.(3)  Truly all
human glory, all temporal honour, all worldly exultation,
compared to Thy eternal glory, is but vanity and folly.  O God my
Truth and my Mercy, Blessed</li></ol></div> </div>
