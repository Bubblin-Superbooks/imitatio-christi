therefore how it will be with thee in another world.  To-day man
is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more.  And being removed out
of sight, quickly also he is out of mind.  O the dulness and
hardness of man's heart, which thinketh only of the present, and
looketh not forward to the future.  Thou oughtest in every deed
and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day.
If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear
death.  It were better for thee to watch</p></div> </div>
