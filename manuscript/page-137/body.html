from all temporal care.  Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou
set a value upon any worldly thing.  Let nothing be great,
nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee,
save God Himself or the things of God.  Reckon as altogether vain
whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature.  The soul
that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God.  God
alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the
solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.</li></ol><hr class="section"></div> </div>
