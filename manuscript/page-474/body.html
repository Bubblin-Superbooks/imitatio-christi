<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:2" start="2"><li class=" stretch-last-line">When thou hast confessed and bewailed these and thy other
shortcomings, with sorrow and sore displeasure at thine own
infirmity, make then a firm resolution of continual amendment of
life and of progress in all that is good.  Then moreover with
full resignation and entire will offer thyself to the honour of
My name on the altar of thine heart as a perpetual whole
burnt-offering, even by faithfully presenting thy body and soul
unto Me, to the end that thou mayest so be accounted worthy to
draw near to offer this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to
God, and to receive the Sacrament of My Body and Blood to thy
soul's health.  For there is no oblation worthier, no
satisfaction greater for the destroying of sin, than that a man
offer himself to God purely and entirely with the oblation</li></ol></div> </div>
