<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xv</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of works of charity</p><p>For no worldly good whatsoever, and for the love of no man, must
anything be done which is evil, but for the help of the suffering
a good work must sometimes be postponed, or be changed for a
better; for herein a good work is not destroyed, but improved.
Without charity no work profiteth, but whatsoever is done in
charity, however small and of no reputation it be, bringeth forth
good fruit; for God verily considereth what a man is able to do,
more than the greatness of what he doth.</p></ol></div> </div>
