<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Ii</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of lowly submission</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind
only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in
whatsoever thou doest.  Have a good conscience and God will defend
thee, for he whom God will help no man's perverseness shall be
able to hurt.  If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to
suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord.  He
knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou
resign thyself to Him.  To God it belongeth to help and to
deliver from all confusion. </p></div> </div>
