men, and that a man's foes are they of his own household,(4) and
that we must not believe if one say unto us Lo here, or Lo
there.(5)  I have been taught by my loss, and O that I may prove
more careful and not foolish hereby.  "Be cautious," saith some
one: "be cautious, keep unto thyself what I tell thee."  And
whilst I am silent and believe that it is hid with me, he himself
cannot keep silence concerning it, but straightway betrayeth me
and himself, and goeth his way.  Protect me, O Lord, from such
mischief-making and reckless men; let me not fall into their
hands, nor ever do such things myself.  Put a true and steadfast
word into my mouth, and remove a deceitful tongue far from me.
What I would not suffer, I ought by all means to</li></ol></div> </div>
