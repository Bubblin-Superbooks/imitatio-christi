<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">others are bearing from us.  He who would weigh well and
rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of
another.</p><ol><li>The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all
cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth
silence concerning others.  Thou wilt never be spiritually minded
and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men's matters
and take full heed to thyself.  If thou think wholly upon thyself
and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee
little.  Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and
when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee,
thyself being neglected?  If thou wouldst have peace and true
unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon
thyself.</li></ol></div> </div>
