because of the necessity by which I was compelled to seek Thee,
seeing there is no man who can comfort me; then could I worthily
trust in Thy grace, and rejoice in the gift of new consolation.</li><li>Thanks be to Thee, from whom all cometh, whensoever it goeth
well with me!  But I am vanity and nothing in Thy sight, a man
inconstant and weak.  What then have I whereof to glory, or why
do I long to be held in honour?  Is it not for nought?  This also
is utterly vain.  Verily vain glory is an evil plague, the
greatest of vanities, because it draweth us away from the true
glory, and robbeth us of heavenly grace.  For whilst a man
pleaseth himself he displeaseth Thee; whilst he gapeth after the
praises of man, he is deprived of true virtues.</li></ol></div> </div>
