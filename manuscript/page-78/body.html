<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xx</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of the love of solitude and silence</p><p>Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of
the mercies of God to thee.  Leave curious questions.  Study such
matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement.  If
thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings
about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy
time sufficient and apt for good meditation.  The greatest saints
used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose
to live in secret with God.</p></ol></div> </div>
