mercies?  Oh that I were able to serve Thee all the days of my

worthy of Thyself!  For verily Thou art worthy of all service,
all honour, and praise without end.  Verily Thou art my God, and

who for Thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find
the sweetest consolation of the Holy</li></ol></div> </div>
