judgments, O Lord, when I find myself nothing else save nothing,
and again nothing!  Oh weight unmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot
be crossed over, where I find nothing of myself save nothing

confidence begotten of virtue?  All vain-glory is swallowed up in
the depths of Thy judgments against me.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">What is all flesh in Thy sight?  For how shall the clay boast
against Him that fashioned it?(2)  How can he be lifted up in
vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to God?  The whole
world shall not lift him up whom Truth hath subdued; nor shall he
be moved by the mouth of all who praise him, who hath placed all
his hope in God.  For they themselves who speak, behold,</li></ol></div> </div>
