whom it is given to consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord of
majesty with holy words, to bless it with the lips, to hold it in

how pure the mouth, how holy the body, how unspotted the heart of
the priest, to whom so often the Author of purity entereth in!
From the mouth of the priest ought naught to proceed but what is
holy, what is honest and profitable, because he so often
receiveth the Sacrament of Christ.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">His eyes ought to be single and pure, seeing they are wont to

of heaven and earth.  To priests is it</li></ol></div> </div>
