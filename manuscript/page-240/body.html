me, and work in me, and persevere with me, even unto the end.
Grant that I may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing
and dear unto Thee.  Let Thy will be mine, and let my will alway
follow Thine, and entirely accord with it.  May I choose and
reject whatsoever Thou dost; yea, let it be impossible for me to
choose or reject except according to Thy will.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Grant that I may die to all worldly things, and for Thy sake
