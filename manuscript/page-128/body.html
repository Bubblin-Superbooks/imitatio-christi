<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Oftentimes it is very profitable for
keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our
faults.</p><ol><li>When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily
pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered
against him.  God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He
loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He
inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and
when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He
revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to
Himself.  The humble man having received reproach, is yet in
sufficient peace, because he resteth on God and not on the world.
Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel
thyself to be inferior to all.</li></ol><hr class="section"></div> </div>
