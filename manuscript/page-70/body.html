sight of God they were precious and beloved.  They stood fast in
true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in
love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and
obtained great favour before God.  To all religious men they were

livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to
carelessness of life.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">O how great was the love of all religious persons at the

prayer!  what rivalry in holiness!  what strict discipline was
observed!  what reverence and obedience under the rule of the
master showed they in all things!  The traces of them that remain
