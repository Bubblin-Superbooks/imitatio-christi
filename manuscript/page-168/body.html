lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true
inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily
mortification.  Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt,
and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than
the way of the Holy Cross.  Dispose and order all things
according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever
find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and
thus thou shalt ever find thy cross.  For thou shalt either feel
pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be
