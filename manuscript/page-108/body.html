weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.  Then
shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in
having fared sumptuously.  Then thou wilt rather rejoice in
having kept silence than in having made long speech.  Then holy
deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.  Then a strict
life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all
earthly delight.  Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou
mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.  Prove first
here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.  If now thou art
able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal
torments?  If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient,
what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not
able to have two Paradises,</li></ol></div> </div>
