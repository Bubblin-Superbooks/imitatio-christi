and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and
hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world
rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh
more readily than after the good pleasure of God.  The world
promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served
with great eagerness.  I promise things that are great and
eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir.  Who serveth
and obeyeth Me in all things, with such carefulness as he serveth
the world and its rulers?
 Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea;(3)
 And if thou reason seekest, hear thou me.</li></ol></div> </div>
