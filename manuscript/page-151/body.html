difficult for a man to be freed from himself.  The holy martyr
Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly
master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed
to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered
even God's chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be
taken from him.  Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the
love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God's
good pleasure.  So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved
friend for the love of God.  Nor take it amiss when thou hast
been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted
from one</li></ol></div> </div>
