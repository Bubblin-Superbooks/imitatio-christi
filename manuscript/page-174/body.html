many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life;
because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in
very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself.  This
it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation
and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.  Drink thou lovingly
thy Lord's cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy
lot with Him.  Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth
best to Him concerning them.  But do thou set thyself to endure
tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed in us,(4) nor would they
be even if thou wert to endure them all.</li></ol></div> </div>
