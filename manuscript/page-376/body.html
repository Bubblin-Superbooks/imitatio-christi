end, and the reward exceeding great; and thou shalt find it no
pain to bear them then, but rather the strongest solace of thy
patience.  For even in exchange for this trifling desire which
thou hast readily forsaken, thou shalt always have thy will in
Heaven.  There verily thou shalt find all that thou wouldst, all
that thou canst long for.  There thou shalt have all good within
thy power without the fear of losing it.  There thy will, ever at
one with Mine, shall desire nothing outward, nothing for itself.
There no man shall withstand thee, none shall complain of thee,
none shall hinder, nothing shall stand in thy path; but all
things desired by thee shall be present together, and shall
refresh thy whole affection, and fill it up even to the brim.
There I</li></ol></div> </div>
