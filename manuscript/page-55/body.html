save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit.</li><li>In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he
hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue
doth the more appear.  Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout
and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he
behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then is there
hope of great progress.  Some are kept safe from great
temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and
common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to
themselves in great things, being weak in small things.</li></ol><p>(1) Job vii. 1 (Vulg.).   (2) 1 Corinthians x. 13.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
