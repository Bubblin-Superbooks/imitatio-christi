and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear.  Thou oughtest
to think worse of thyself, and to believe no man weaker than
thyself.  If thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying
words above their value.  It is no small prudence to keep silence
in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto Me, and not to be
troubled by human judgment.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">"Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether
