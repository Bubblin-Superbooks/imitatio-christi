<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:5" start="5"><li class="split-li ">avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest
thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all.  Good cause have
we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of
ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable.  And quickly
may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was
hardly attained through grace.</li><li>What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are
lukewarm and idle?  Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though
it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign
appeareth in our life of true holiness.  Rather had we need that
we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed
unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future
amendment and greater spiritual increase.</li></ol><p>(1) Psalm xxv. 17.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
