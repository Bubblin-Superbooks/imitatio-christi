trial.  Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the
earth is a trial.(1)  And therefore ought each of us to give heed
concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest
the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but
goeth about seeking whom he may devour.  No man is so perfect in
holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be
wholly free from them.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn</li></ol></div> </div>
