<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:5" start="5"><li class="split-li ">men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends,
whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns
and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour
when I am deserted by God's favour and left to mine own poverty.
There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of
self, and an abiding in the will of God.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he
felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of
fervour.  No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so
enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted.  For he is
not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God's sake, hath
not been exercised by some temptation.  For temptation is wont
to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow,</li></ol></div> </div>
