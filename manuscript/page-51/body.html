profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through
them we are humbled, purified, instructed.  All Saints have
passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited
thereby.  And they who endured not temptation became reprobate
and fell away.  There is no position so sacred, no place so
secret, that it is without temptations and adversities.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he
liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves,
in that we are born in concupiscence.  One temptation or sorrow
passeth, and another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat
to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness. Many who
seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply</li></ol></div> </div>
