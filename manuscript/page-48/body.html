<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xii</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of the uses of adversity</p><p>It is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities,
for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger
and sojourner, and may not put his trust in any worldly thing.
It is good that we sometimes endure contradictions, and are
hardly and unfairly judged, when we do and mean what is good.
For these things help us to be humble, and shield us from
vain-glory.  For then we seek the more earnestly the witness of
God, when men speak evil of us falsely, and give us no credit for
good.</p></ol></div> </div>
