Ah!  long life doth not always amend, but often the more
increaseth guilt.  Oh that we might spend a single day in this
world as it ought to be spent!  Many there are who reckon the
years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is
the fruit thereof.  If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be
perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.  Happy is the
man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and
daily prepareth himself to die.  If thou hast ever seen one die,
consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.</li></ol></div> </div>
