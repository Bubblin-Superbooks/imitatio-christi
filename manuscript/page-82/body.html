learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures.  Therein findeth
she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each

dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction.  To him who

his holy angels will draw nigh.  It is better to be unknown and
take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders.
