lovers of the world also are deceived in that they love only
visible things.  What is a man better because by man he is
reckoned very great?  The deceiver deceiveth the deceiver, the
vain man the vain, the blind man the blind, the weak man the
weak, when they exalt one another; and in truth they rather put
to shame, while they foolishly praise.  For as humble St. Francis
saith, "What each one is in Thine eyes, so much he is, and no
more."</li></ol><p class=" stretch-last-line ">(1) Psalm lxxxviii. 15.   (2) Job xxix. 3.   (3) Psalm xvii.</p></div> </div>
