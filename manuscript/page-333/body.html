that Thou visitest him?(1)  What hath man deserved, that Thou
shouldest bestow thy favour upon him?  Lord, what cause can I
have of complaint, if Thou forsake me?  Or what can I justly
allege, if Thou refuse to hear my petition?  Of a truth, this I
may truly think and say, Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing that
is good of myself, but I fall short in all things, and ever tend
unto nothing.  And unless I am helped by Thee</p></div> </div>
