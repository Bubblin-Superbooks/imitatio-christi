<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">showed me the sweetness of Thy charity, that when I
was not, Thou madest me, and when I wandered far from Thee, Thou
broughtest me back that I might serve Thee, and commandedst me to
love Thee.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">O Fountain of perpetual love, what shall I say concerning
Thee?  How shall I be unmindful of Thee, who didst vouchsafe to
remember me, even after I pined away and perished?  Thou hast had
mercy beyond all hope upon Thy servant, and hast showed Thy grace
and friendship beyond all deserving.  What reward shall I render
Thee for this Thy grace?  For it is not given unto all to
renounce this world and its affairs, and to take up a religious
life.  For is it a great thing that I should serve Thee, whom
every creature ought to serve?  It ought not to seem a great
thing to me to serve Thee; but rather this appeareth to me</li></ol></div> </div>
