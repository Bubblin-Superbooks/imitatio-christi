this life, without which this miserable life would be intolerable
to me; being detained in the prison of this body, I confess that
I need two things, even food and light.  Thou hast therefore
given to me who am so weak, Thy sacred Body and Blood, for the
refreshing of my soul and body, and hast set Thy Word for a
lantern to my feet.(3)  Without these two I could not properly
live; for the Word of God is the light of my soul, and Thy
Sacrament the bread of life.  These may also be called the two
tables, placed on this side and on that, in the treasury of Thy
holy Church.  One table is that of the Sacred Altar, bearing the
holy bread, that is the precious Body and Blood of Christ; the
other is the table of the Divine Law, containing holy doctrine,
teaching the true faith, and leading steadfastly onwards</li></ol></div> </div>
