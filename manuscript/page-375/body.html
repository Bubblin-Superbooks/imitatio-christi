this or that shall be entrusted; thou shalt be judged useful for
nought.</li><li>"For this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness;
and it is a great thing if thou bear it silently.  In this and
many like things the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be
tried, how far he is able to deny himself and bring himself into
subjection in all things.  Scarcely is there anything in which
thou hast need to mortify thyself so much as in seeing things
which are adverse to thy will; especially when things are
commanded thee to be done which seem to thee inexpedient or of
little use to thee.  And because thou darest not resist a higher
power, being under authority, therefore it seemeth hard for thee
to shape thy course according to the nod of another, and to
forego thine own opinion.</li></ol></div> </div>
