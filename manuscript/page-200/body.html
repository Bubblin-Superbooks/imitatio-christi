<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:6" start="6"><li class="split-li ">manly, and never
seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he
falleth from love.  Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not
weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste,
steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses.  Love is subject
and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its
own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always
trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without
sorrow we cannot live in love.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to
the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of
God.  It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard
and bitter things for the Beloved's sake, and not to be drawn
away from Him because of any contrary</li></ol></div> </div>
