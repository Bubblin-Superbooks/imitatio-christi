I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou
mayest be rich,(1) that is heavenly wisdom, which despiseth all
base things.  Put away from thee earthly wisdom, and all
pleasure, whether common to men, or thine own.</li><li>"I tell thee that thou must buy vile things with those which
are costly and great in the esteem of men.  For wonderfully vile
and small, and almost given up to forgetfulness, doth true
heavenly wisdom appear, which thinketh not high things of itself,
nor seeketh to be magnified upon the earth; many honour it with
their lips, but in heart are far from it; it is indeed the
precious pearl, which is hidden from many."</li></ol><p>(1) Revelation iii. 18.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
