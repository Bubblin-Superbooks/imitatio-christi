doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination.
Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not
that all things belonging to us are so defiled.  For because all
flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came.

followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being
the index of a deficient inward strength.  Out of a pure heart
proceedeth the fruit of good living.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue
