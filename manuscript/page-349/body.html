How often have I failed to find faithfulness, where I thought I
possessed it.  How many times I have found it where I least
expected.  Vain therefore is hope in men, but the salvation of
the just, O God, is in Thee.  Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in
all things which happen unto us.  We are weak and unstable, we
are quickly deceived and quite changed.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">Who is the man who is able to keep himself</li></ol></div> </div>
