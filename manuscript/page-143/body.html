must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt

unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able
to help thee.  Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will
suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king
will sit upon His own throne.  If thou wouldst learn to put away
from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His
abode with thee.  Thou wilt find all trust little better than
lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus.  Trust not
nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is
grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the
field.(1)</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest</li></ol></div> </div>
