towards Thee, and no more suffer any other consolation to enter
into me.  For this most high and most glorious Sacrament is the
health of the soul and the body, the medicine of all spiritual
sickness, whereby I am healed of my sins, my passions are
bridled, temptations are conquered or weakened, more grace is
poured into me, virtue begun is increased, faith is made firm,
hope is strengthened, and charity is enkindled and enlarged.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">For in this Sacrament Thou hast bestowed many good things and

infirmity, and Giver of all inward consolation.  For Thou pourest
