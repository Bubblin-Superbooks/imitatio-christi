is change of character and entire mortification of the affections
which make a truly religious man.  He who seeketh aught save God
and the health of his soul, shall find only tribulation and
sorrow.  Nor can he stand long in peace, who striveth not to be
least of all and servant of all.</li><li>Thou art called to endure and to labour, not to a life of ease
and trifling talk.  Here therefore are men tried as gold in the
furnace.  No man can stand, unless with all his heart he will
humble himself for God's sake.</li></ol><hr class="section"></div> </div>
