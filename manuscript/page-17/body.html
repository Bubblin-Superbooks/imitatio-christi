<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Ii</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of thinking humbly of oneself</p><p>There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what
profiteth knowledge without the fear of God?  Better of a surety
is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who
watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.  He
who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither
regardeth he the praises of men.  If I knew all the things that
are in the world, and were not in charity, what should it help me
before God, who is to judge me according to my deeds?</p></ol></div> </div>
