<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol><li>Therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon God, so that he
needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men.  When a man who
feareth God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil
thoughts, then he seeth that God is the more necessary unto him,
since without God he can do no good thing.  Then he is heavy of
heart, he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of
his heart.  Then he groweth weary of life, and would fain depart
and be with Christ.  By all this he is taught that in the world
there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace.</li></ol><hr class="section"></div> </div>
