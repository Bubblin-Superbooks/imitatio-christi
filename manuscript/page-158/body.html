But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own
will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.</p><ol><li>Great is the difference between a visitation from above and

is grateful and that is taken away from the proud, which is wont
to be given to the humble.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction,
