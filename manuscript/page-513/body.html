grace of devotion is to be waited for with a good hope and with
humble patience.  Yet impute it to thyself and to thy sins when
it is not given, or when it is mysteriously taken away.  It is
sometimes a small thing which hindereth and hideth grace; (if
indeed that ought to be called small and not rather great, which
hindereth so great a good); but if thou remove this, be it small
or great, and perfectly overcome it, thou wilt have what thou
