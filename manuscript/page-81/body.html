world.  O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never
sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with
the world!  O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who
would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and
divine things, and build his whole hope upon God!</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath
diligently exercised himself in holy compunction.  If thou wilt
feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and
shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with
your own heart in your own chamber and be still.(1)  In
retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad.
Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou
keep not in it,</li></ol></div> </div>
