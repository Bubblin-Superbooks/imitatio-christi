<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">desirest aught beyond Jesus!  Is not
this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world?</p><ol><li>What can the world profit thee without Jesus?  To be without
Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet
paradise.  If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee.  He
who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all
good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more
than the whole world.  Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus,
and most rich is he who is much with Jesus.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know
how to hold Jesus is great wisdom.  Be thou humble and peaceable
and Jesus shall be with thee.  Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will
remain with thee.  Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose
His favour if thou wilt turn away</li></ol></div> </div>
