way of Thy commandments.  Grant me to understand Thy will and to
be mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great
reverence and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able
worthily to give Thee thanks.  Yet I know and confess that I
cannot render Thee due praises for the least of Thy mercies.  I
am less than the least of all the good things which Thou gavest
me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit faileth because of
the greatness</p></div> </div>
