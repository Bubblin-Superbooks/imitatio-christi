Him continually.</li><li>Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of
Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among
all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour!
For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise
it.  Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many
suffer heavier things for the world.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of
a dying man.  And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he
beginneth to live towards God.  None is fit for the understanding
of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing
adversities for Christ.  Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing
more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer
willingly</li></ol></div> </div>
