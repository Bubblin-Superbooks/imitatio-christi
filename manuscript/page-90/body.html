<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xxii</h3><p class="  start-chapter">On the contemplation of human misery</p><p>Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou
turnest, unless thou turn thee to God.  Why art thou disquieted
because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and
desires?  Who is he that hath everything according to his will?
Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth.  There is no man
in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or
Pope.  Who is he who hath the happiest lot?  Even he who is
strong to suffer somewhat for God.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">There are many foolish and unstable men</li></ol></div> </div>
