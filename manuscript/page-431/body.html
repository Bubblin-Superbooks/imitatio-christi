greatest comfort of all the things which are seen under Heaven?
Is it not Thou, O Lord my God, whose mercies are without number?
Where hath it been well with me without Thee?  Or when could it
be evil whilst Thou wert near?  I had rather be poor for Thy
sake, than rich without Thee.  I choose rather to be a pilgrim
upon the earth with Thee than without Thee to possess heaven.
Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where Thou are not, behold
there death</p></div> </div>
