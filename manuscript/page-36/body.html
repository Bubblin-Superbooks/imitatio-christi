<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Viii</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of the danger of too much familiarity</p><p>Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise
and feareth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers.  Be
not a flatterer of the rich; nor willingly seek the society of
the great.  Let thy company be the humble and the simple, the
devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning things
which edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good
women alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His
Angels only, and flee from the notice of men.</p></ol></div> </div>
