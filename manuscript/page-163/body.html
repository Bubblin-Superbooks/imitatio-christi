long as they receive any comforts from Him.  But if Jesus hide
Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either
into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.</p><ol><li>But they who love Jesus for Jesus' sake, and not for any
consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and
anguish of heart as in the highest consolation.  And if He should
never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always
praise Him and always give Him thanks.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any
gain or love of self!  Should not all they be called mercenary
who are always seeking consolations?  Do they not prove
themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always
seeking their own gain and advantage?  Where shall be found one
who is willing to serve</li></ol></div> </div>
