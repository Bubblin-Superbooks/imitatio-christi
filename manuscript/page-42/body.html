outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner comfort
which cometh from God.  Therefore must we watch and pray that

to speak, speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and
neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of
watching over our lips.  Nevertheless, devout conversation on
spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress, most
of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground
of fellowship in God.</li></ol><hr class="section"></div> </div>
