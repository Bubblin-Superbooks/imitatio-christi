<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:7" start="7"><li class="split-li ">wilt never be able to attain unto this.  If thou shouldest
see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain
vision?  Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy
sins and negligences may be forgiven.  Leave vain things to vain
men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee.
Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved.
Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find
so great peace.  If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to
vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.  But
because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou
must therefore suffer trouble of heart.</li></ol><p>(1) Psalm iv. 4.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
