the abundant flowing of holy tears?  Surely in Thy presence and
in the presence of the holy Angels my whole heart ought to burn

to behold Thee, neither could the whole world stand before the
splendour of the glory of Thy Majesty.  In this therefore Thou
hast consideration unto my weakness, that Thou hidest Thyself
under the Sacrament.  I verily possess and adore Him whom the
Angels adore in heaven; I yet for a while by faith, but they by
sight and without a veil.  It is good for me to be content with
the light of true faith, and to walk therein until the day of
eternal brightness dawn, and the shadows of figures flee</li></ol></div> </div>
