before Thee my mouth is without speech, and my silence speaketh
to Thee.  How long will my Lord delay to come unto me?  Let Him
come unto me, His poor and humble one, and make me glad.  Let Him
put forth His hand, and deliver His holy one from every snare.
Come, Oh come; for without Thee shall be no joyful day or hour,
for Thou art my joy, and without Thee is my table empty.  I am
miserable,</li></ol></div> </div>
