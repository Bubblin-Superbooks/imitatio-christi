High God.  Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought
to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He
suffereth to come upon us.  He who seeketh to retain the favour
of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and
patient in respect of that which is taken away.  Let him pray
that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it
not.</li></ol><p>(1) Matthew xxii. 21.   (2) Luke xiv. 10.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
