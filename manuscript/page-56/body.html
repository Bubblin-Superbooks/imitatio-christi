<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xiv</h3><p class="  start-chapter">On avoiding rash judgment</p><p>Look well unto thyself, and beware that thou judge not the doings
of others.  In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often
erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining
himself he always laboureth to good purpose.  According as a
matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for
easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal
feeling.  If God were always the sole object of our desire, we
should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our
fancy.</p></ol></div> </div>
