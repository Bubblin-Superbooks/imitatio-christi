be truly happy.  Out of such purpose thy affection shall be
purified, which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon
created things.  For if thou seekest thyself in any matter,
straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren.
Therefore refer everything to Me first of all, for it is I who
gave thee all.  So look upon each blessing as flowing from the
Supreme Good, and thus all things are to be attributed</p></div> </div>
