comforted of Me, behold in the contempt of all worldly things and
in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy
blessing, and fulness of consolation shall be given thee.  And
the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures,
the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find.  But at
the first thou shalt not attain to them, without some sorrow and
hard striving.  Long-accustomed habit will oppose, but it shall
be overcome by better habit.  The flesh will murmur again and
again, but will be restrained by fervour of spirit.  The old
serpent will urge and embitter thee, but will be put to flight by
prayer; moreover, by useful labour his entrance will be greatly
obstructed."</li></ol><p>(1) Ecclesiastes xviii. 30.   (2) Psalm xxxvii. 4.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
