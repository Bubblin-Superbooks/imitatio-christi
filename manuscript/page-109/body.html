this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.</li><li>If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and
pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to
thee in an instant?  All therefore is vanity, save to love God
and to serve Him only.  For he who loveth God with all his heart
feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell,
because perfect love giveth sure access to God.  But he who still
delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and
judgment.  Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot
restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should
hold thee back.  But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot
long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of
the devil.</li></ol></div> </div>
