<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol><li>O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I
should dare to speak unto Thee?  I am the very poorest of Thy
servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I
know or dare to say.  Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am
nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing.  Thou only art good,
just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things,
fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner.  Call to mind
Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who
wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace
strengthen me?  Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy
visitation.  Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul
"gasp after thee as a thirsty land."  Lord,</li></ol></div> </div>
