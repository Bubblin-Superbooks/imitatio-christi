so wide a vogue or so sustained a popularity as this.  And yet,
in one sense, it is hardly an original work at all.  Its
structure it owes largely to the writings of the medieval
mystics, and its ideas and phrases are a mosaic from the Bible
and the Fathers of the early Church.  But these elements are
