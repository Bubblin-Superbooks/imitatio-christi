virtues, and renderest him who is rich in many things humble in
spirit, come Thou, descend upon me, fill me early with Thy
consolation, lest my soul fail through weariness and drought of
mind.  I beseech thee, O Lord, that I may find grace in Thy
sight, for Thy grace is sufficient for me,(4) when I obtain not
those things which Nature longeth for.  If I be tempted and vexed
with many tribulations, I will fear no evil, while Thy grace
remaineth with me.  This alone is my strength, this bringeth me
counsel and help.  It is more powerful than all enemies,</li></ol></div> </div>
