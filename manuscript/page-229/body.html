without bitterness and weariness and fear.  For from the very
same thing wherein they find delight, thence they oftentimes have
the punishment of sorrow.  Justly it befalleth them, that because
out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures, they enjoy
them not without confusion and bitterness.  Oh how short, how
false, how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures!  Yet
because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand;
but like brute beasts, for the sake of a little pleasure of this
corruptible life, they incur death of the soul.  Thou therefore,
my son, go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine
appetites.(1)  Delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee
thy heart's desire.(2)</li></ol></div> </div>
