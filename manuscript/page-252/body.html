<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">little, see that it is not
thy impatience which is the cause of this.  But whether they be
little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with
patience.</p><ol><li>"So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou
dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also
bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained
hereunto.  And say not 'I cannot bear these things from such a
man, nor are things of this kind to be borne by me, for he hath
done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what I had never
thought: but from another I will suffer patiently, such things as
I see I ought to suffer.'  Foolish  is such a thought as this,
for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by whom that
virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and
offences against self.</li></ol></div> </div>
