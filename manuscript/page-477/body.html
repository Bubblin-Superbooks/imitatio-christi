<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">than thou
study to resign thyself altogether unto Me?  Whatsoever thou givest
besides thyself, I nothing care for, for I ask not thy gift, but
thee.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">As it would not be sufficient for thee if thou hadst all
things except Me, even so whatsoever thou shalt give Me, if thou
give Me not thyself, it cannot please Me.  Offer thyself to Me,
and give thyself altogether for God, so shall thy offering be
accepted.  Behold I offered Myself altogether to the Father for
thee, I give also My whole body and blood for food, that thou
mightest remain altogether Mine and I thine.  But if thou stand
in thyself, and offer not thyself freely to My will, thy offering
is not perfect, neither shall the union betwixt us be complete.
Therefore ought the freewill offering of thyself into the hands
of God to go before all thy works, if thou wilt attain</li></ol></div> </div>
