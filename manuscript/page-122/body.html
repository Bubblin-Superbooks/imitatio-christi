man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should
much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict
us.  They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against
thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy
whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will
answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best.  Here
hast thou no continuing city,(3)  and wheresoever thou art, thou
art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest
unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this
is not the place of thy rest?  In heaven ought thy habitation to
be, and all earthly</li></ol></div> </div>
