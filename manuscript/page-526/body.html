paths of questionings, and followeth the plain and firm steps of
God's commandments.  Many have lost devotion whilst they sought
to search into deeper things.  Faith is required of thee, and a
sincere life, not loftiness of intellect, nor deepness in the
mysteries of God.  If thou understandest not nor comprehendest
the things which are beneath thee, how shalt thou comprehend
those which are above thee?  Submit thyself unto God, and humble
thy sense to faith, and the light of knowledge shall be given
thee, as shall be profitable and necessary unto thee.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">There are some who are grievously tempted</li></ol></div> </div>
