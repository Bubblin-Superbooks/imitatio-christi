Thee, let this come to pass.  Lord, if this shall be for Thine
honour, let it be done in Thy Name.  Lord, if thou see it good
for me, and approve it as useful, then grant me to use it for Thy
honour.  But if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me,
and not profitable for the health of my soul, take the desire
away from me'!  For not every desire is from the Holy Ghost,
although it appear to a man right and good.  It is difficult to
judge</p></div> </div>
