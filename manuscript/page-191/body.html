heart seek Me continually.  He who walketh before Me in the truth
shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him
from the wiles and slanders of the wicked.  If the truth shall
make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for
the vain words of men."</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so
