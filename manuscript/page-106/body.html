poverty.  An hour's pain there shall be more grievous than a
hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.  No quiet shall be
there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is
respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends.  Be
thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of
judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.  For then
shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face
of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his
labours.(1)  Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now
submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.  Then
shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the
proud is taken with fear on every side.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man</li></ol></div> </div>
