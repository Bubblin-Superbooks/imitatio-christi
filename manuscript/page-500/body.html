out of the merit of any action of thine, even though thou
shouldest prepare thyself for a whole year, and hadst nothing

thou permitted to draw nigh unto My table; as though a beggar
were called to a rich man's dinner, and had no other recompense
to offer him for the benefits done unto him, but to humble
himself and to give him thanks.  Do therefore as much as lieth in
thee, and do it diligently, not of custom, nor of necessity, but
with fear, reverence, and affection,</li></ol></div> </div>
