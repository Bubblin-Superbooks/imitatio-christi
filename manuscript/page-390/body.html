more worthy of chastisement</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">O Lord, I am not worthy of Thy consolation, nor of any spiritual
visitation; and therefore Thou dealest justly with me, when Thou
leavest me poor and desolate.  For if I were able to pour forth
tears like the sea, still should I not be worthy of Thy
consolation.  Therefore am I nothing worthy save to be scourged
and punished, because I have grievously and many a time offended
Thee, and in many things have greatly sinned.  Therefore, true
account being taken, I am not worthy</p></div> </div>
