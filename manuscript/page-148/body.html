who hath none like unto Himself.  Nor wish thou that any one set

any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any
created thing.  Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to
God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord
is.  And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His
grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and
dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God.  For when the
grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all
things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and
given up unto troubles.  In these thou art not to be cast</li></ol></div> </div>
