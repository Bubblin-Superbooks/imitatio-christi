require His Grace</p><p>The Voice of the Disciple</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">O most sweet and loving Lord, whom now I devoutly desire to
receive, Thou knowest my infirmity and the necessity which I
suffer, in what evils and vices I lie; how often I am weighed
down, tempted, disturbed, and defiled.  I come unto Thee for
remedy, I beseech of Thee consolation and support.  I speak unto
Thee who knowest all things, to whom all my secrets are open, and
who alone art able perfectly to comfort and help me. </p></div> </div>
