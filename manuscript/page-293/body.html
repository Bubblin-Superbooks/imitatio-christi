temptation and trouble to come upon me.  I cannot escape it, but
have need to flee unto Thee, that Thou mayest succour me and turn
it unto me for good.  Lord, now am I in tribulation, and it is
not well within my heart, but I am sore vexed by the suffering
which lieth upon me.  And now, O dear Father, what shall I say?
I am taken among the snares.  Save me from this hour, but for
this cause came I unto this hour,(1)</p></div> </div>
