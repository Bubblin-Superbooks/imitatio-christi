For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.(1)  Give ear
to My words, for they kindle the heart and enlighten the mind,
they bring contrition, and they supply manifold consolations.
Never read thou the word that thou mayest appear more learned or
wise; but study for the mortification of thy sins, for this will
be far more profitable for thee than the knowledge of many
difficult questions.</p><ol style="--start:1" start="1"><li class=" stretch-last-line">"When thou hast read and learned many</li></ol></div> </div>
