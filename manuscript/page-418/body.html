some faults</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"My Son, patience and humility in adversities are more pleasing
to Me than much comfort and devotion in prosperity.  Why doth a
little thing spoken against thee make thee sad?  If it had been
more, thou still oughtest not to be moved.  But now suffer it to
go by; it is not the first, it is not new, and it will not be the
last, if thou live long.  Thou art brave enough, so long as no
adversity meeteth thee.  Thou givest good counsel also, and
knowest how to strengthen others with thy words;</p></div> </div>
