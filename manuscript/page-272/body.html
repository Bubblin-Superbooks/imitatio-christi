perfectness.  It is short in words but full of meaning, and
abundant in fruit.  For if it were possible that I should fully
keep it, disturbance would not so easily arise within me.  For as
often as I feel myself disquieted and weighed down, I find myself
to have gone back from this teaching.  But Thou, Who art
Almighty, and always lovest progress in the soul, vouchsafe more
grace, that I may be enabled to fulfil Thy exhortation, and work
out my salvation.
