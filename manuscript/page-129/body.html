well-learned.  A passionate man turneth even good into evil and
easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all
things into good.  He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of
none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many
suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to
be quiet.  He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth
what it were more</p></div> </div>
