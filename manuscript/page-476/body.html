Cross for thy sins with outstretched hands and naked body, so
that nothing remained in Me that did not become altogether a
sacrifice for the Divine propitiation; so also oughtest thou
every day to offer thyself willingly unto Me for a pure and holy
oblation with all thy strength and affections, even to the utmost
powers of thine heart.  What more do I require of thee</p></div> </div>
