<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Chapter Xi</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of
His Cross.  He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of
tribulation.  He findeth many companions of His table, but few of
His fasting.  All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to
undergo anything for His sake.  Many follow Jesus that they may
eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His
passion.  Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after
the shame of His Cross.  Many love Jesus so long as no
adversities happen to them. </p></div> </div>
