whole confidence; for my own conscience sufficeth me not.  Thou
knowest what I know not; and therefore ought I under all rebuke
to humble myself, and to bear it meekly.  Therefore mercifully
forgive me as often as I have not done this, and grant me the
next time the grace of greater endurance.  For better unto me is
Thine abundant pity for the attainment of Thy pardon, than the
righteousness which I believe myself to have for defence against
my conscience, which lieth wait against me.  Although I know
nothing against myself, yet I am not hereby justified,(4) because
if Thy mercy were removed away, in Thy sight should no man
living be justified.(5)</li></ol><p>(1) Luke ii. 35.   (2) Proverbs xii. 21.   (3) Psalm vii. 9.
